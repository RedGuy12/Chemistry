		<h1>My paragraph about Phosphorus</h1>
		<p>
			Phosphorus is in DNA, RNA, ATP, bones, and urine; which are in bodies; baking powder; which bakers use in
			their baked goods; fertilizers and detergents; which are cleansers; bombs, grenades, and nuclear fuel; which
			are weapons, and matches. In 1669, an alchemist named Hennig Brand boiled his urine in hopes of creating
			gold. It may sound weird, but back then, creating gold was every chemist's dream. And urine and gold are
			both yellow, so he thought there might be some connection. So, he boiled it, and he was left with a white,
			mushy substance, which glowed in the dark and burned violently. Brand thought it was some form of gold. He
			kept the recipe to his discovery a secret, but he eventually sold it to Antoine Lavoisier in 1777. Lavoisier
			realized that it was not gold, but a chemical element, making it the 13th chemical element to be discovered.
			Phosphorus's name means 'light-bearer, ' in Greek.
