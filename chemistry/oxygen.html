		<h1>My article about Oxygen</h1>
		<h2>Uses</h2>
		<p>
			<img style="height: 200px; float: left" src="images/in.png" alt="Oxygen is in" />Oxygen is in Earth's crust,
			water, rust, bones, and teeth.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img style="height: 200px; float: right" src="images/clean.png" alt="Scrubing with bleach" />When oxygen
			atoms are alone, they can be dangerous, which is why there is a single oxygen trailing off bleach molecules.
			When you scrub with bleach, the oxygen comes off and kills bacteria. The water makes the pan slippery, so
			the germs slide off! There are not enough single oxygens in bleach to be threatening to humans.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img style="height: 200px; float: left" src="images/breath.png " alt="Breathing" />Dioxygen, which is two
			oxygen atoms together, is what is in the air for us and all animals to breath.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img style="height: 200px; float: right" src="images/ozone.png" alt="2016 Ozone Consentration" />A layer of
			ozone (three oxygens) surrounds our planet to protect us from the sun's harmful UV rays, but some rays can
			still get through and burn you, so you wear sunblock!
		</p>
		<p>
			<img style="height: 200px; float: left" src="images/plant.png" alt="Photosynthesis" />Though photosynthesis,
			plants separate many CO2 (carbon dioxide) molecules into many single oxygens and dicarbons so they can
			survive. The plant releases those single oxygens into the air and bond with each other to form dioxygens, so
			they would not be dangerous.
		</p>

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			<img style="width: 200px; float: right" src="images/rb.png" alt="Robert Boyle" />In the early 1700s, Robert
			Boyle realized that air is required for burning.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img style="width: 200px; float: left" src="images/jm.png" alt="John Mayow" />In the late 1700s, John Mayow
			found out that it is only a part of air that is needed. He called it 'spiritus nitroarenes'. Mayhow also
			correctly guessed how lungs use oxygen for breathing and its vital role in the human body.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img style="width: 200px; float: right" src="images/jp.png" alt="Joseph Priestley" />On August 1st, 1774,
			Joseph Priestley separated oxygen from anything else. He noticed that candles burnt longer in the gas and
			mice live longer while inhaling it plain. He then inhaled the special air himself and noticed no significant
			difference between it and the regular air.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img
				style="width: 200px; float: left"
				src="images/jp-book.png"
				alt="'Experiments and Observations on different kinds of Air', 2nd Edition, by Joseph Priestley"
			/>Because Priestly published his work first, he is widely credited with discovering oxygen, but Michael
			Sendivogius in the early 1610s and Carl William Schlee in the late 1760s both independently isolated oxygen
			before him.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img style="width: 200px; float: right" src="images/al.png" alt="Antoine Lavoisier" />Schlee and Priestley
			both told Antoine Lavoisier about their findings and Lavoisier decided that it was a new element! He named
			from the Greek words for 'acid' and 'producer' because he wrongly thought it was in all acids.
